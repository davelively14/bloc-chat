# Bloc Chat

Chat messaging with Firebase and AngularJS

## Overview

A chat app that allows users to connect to various chat rooms and send messages. Using the AngularJS binding [AngularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire), we store those messages remotely on a Firebase server. When users join a room, they have access to the messages.

## How to run

From the command line, simply run:

```
$ grunt
```

Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
